# SkillFund
### A Peer-to-Peer Learning Platform for Students, by Students  

SkillFund is a platform designed to empower students by enabling them to **monetize their skills** while also helping other students **learn** better. We foster a community-driven approach, and bridge the gap between skilled individuals and students who seek for those knowledge and skills. We uniquely facilitate **localized solutions** and **overall growth**.
